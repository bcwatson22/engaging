# Engaging Engineering

This is a project created with Next, Node, GraphQL, Vitest, TypeScript, Tailwind and Framer - powered by Hygraph, deployed and hosted with Vercel. The Home page showcases technologies and expertise offered by Engaging Engineering, and the CV page is an interactive overview of Billy Watson's vast range of skills and experience.

## Next

It uses Next's app router, making use of ISR and dynamic favicons (via code), manifest, robots and sitemap.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is used to query and fetch data from Hygraph's headless endpoint via URQL - ensuring a rapid, typed and sensibly-cached approach to enhance DX.

## Node

Several custom Node functions are used to save local versions of GraphQL query responses to ensure up-to-date backups.

## Vitest

Over 96% code coverage achieved with blazing fast test runner with enhanced DX.

## TypeScript

Of course, everything is strongly typed!

## Tailwind

Flexibility and speed of development made the use of Tailwind a no-brainer. The clock animation on the Home page was fiddly but worth it!

## Framer

Subtle interactions bring the CV page to life, both via scroll-anchored line animations and scroll-triggered section animations.

## Hygraph

Hygraph was chosen as the Headless CMS. Their approach to content modelling, custom components and field validation makes for a really pleasing UX.

## Vercel

Using Vercel to deploy and host any Next project is an absolute dream, the use of webhooks into Hygraph publishes make it completely seamless to ensure up-to-date content and builds.
