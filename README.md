# Engaging Engineering

This is a project created with [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/) - powered by [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/), deployed and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The [Home page](https://www.engaging.engineering/) showcases technologies and expertise offered by Engaging Engineering, and the [CV page](https://www.engaging.engineering/cv) is an interactive overview of Billy Watson's vast range of skills and experience.

To get it running locally, run `pnpm i` (if you don't have the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager installed you can do this with `npm i -g pnpm`) and then `pnpm dev` to spin up the dev server.
